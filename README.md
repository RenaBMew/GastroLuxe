## _A Meal Planning App for Luxe Gastrophiles._

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) that allows users to search the [`Spoonacular API`](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) for meals and create a favorites list for quick reference to preferred meals. Users who enjoy organizing their day will also be able to create a meal plan that features breakfast, lunch, and dinner options.

This application is created to help individuals experience and learn about the joy of cooking and how preparing meals at home can help save money, maintain a healthier lifestyle, and the joy of sharing meals with others.

- Some additional work is needed for mobile users: icon activation adjustments, calendar view adjustments (accordion style layout for calendar for better interactions and view).
